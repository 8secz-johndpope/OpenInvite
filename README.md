## OpenInvite

### Summary

This is the repository for OpenInvite, an iOS project put together in under 24 hours for the TAMUhack 2019 hackathon. We aimed to create an application to easily share invites with friends in one manageable application. The application is written entirely in Swift with backend communication done via Firebase/Firestore's tools. We also competed and won first place for best use of Snapchat's Snapkit APIs. We used Snapkit's authentication API for authentication in the app, as well as Snapkit's Bitmoji API for Bitmoji support all throughout the app. Additionally, we integrated a basic use case of Apple's Mapkit API to display invite locations also with the use of Bitmojis. Beyond this we created a custom UI heavily based off Snapchat's to mimic the look and feel of using their application.

### Build Instructions

To build this application you will need to download Cocoapods and run `pod install` in the app's home directory. That should be all that is needed, however it may take a few times as Cocoapods can be a little squirrely.
